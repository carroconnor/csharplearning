One the projects I have been adding to throughout my time at Eleven Fifty Coding Acadamy was my C# Library.  The C# Library is a 
collection of different programming techniques and challenges a beginner should first know before moving on to more advanced topics.
I made this as something to refer back to in the future for sytax and other review.
